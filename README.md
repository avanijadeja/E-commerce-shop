# E-commerce-shop
e-commerce-shop uses Redux to manage global state.

# Description
 
In E-commerce-shop application,

## User Story

- AS a senior engineer working on an e-commerce platform,
  I WANT my platform to use Redux to manage global state instead of the Context API,
  SO THAT my website's state management is taken out of the React ecosystem.

## Acceptance Criteria

GIVEN an e-commerce platform that uses Redux to manage global state,
- WHEN I review the appâ€™s store,
  THEN I find that the app uses a Redux store instead of the Context API.
- WHEN I review the way the React front end accesses the store,
  THEN I find that the app uses a Redux provider.
- WHEN I review the way the app determines changes to its global state,
  THEN I find that the app passes reducers to a Redux store instead of using the Context API.
- WHEN I review the way the app extracts state data from the store,
  THEN I find that the app uses Redux instead of the Context API.
- WHEN I review the way the app dispatches actions.
  THEN I find that the app uses Redux instead of the Context API.
